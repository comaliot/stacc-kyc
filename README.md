# Stacc code challenge

## Task description
The goal was to create a web app to check for people on a PEP[^1] list. I built a React website with a search field where one can look up such people and get data back related to searched person from a used .json file.

## How to run
`npm install` to install all required dependencies.

`npm start` to start the local server.

## Comments
**The website is a work in progress** and is not fully working due to a lack of knowledge in certain fields.


[^1]: In financial regulation, a politically exposed person (PEP) is one who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms "politically exposed person" and senior foreign political figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.
